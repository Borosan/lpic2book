#### Linux Boot Loader

The grandfather of all linux boot loaders is LiLo \(Linux boot Loader\). LiLo has its configuration file in /etc/lilo.conf which was compiled to binary and reside on first sectors of hard disk. But all those good days of simplicity have been passed.

```
#sample lilo.conf of system configured to boot 2 operating system.
boot=/dev/hda
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
prompt
timeout=50
message=/boot/message
lba32
default=linux

image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.0-0.43.6
    label=linux
    initrd=/boot/initrd-2.4.0-0.43.6.img
    read-only
    root=/dev/hda5

other=/dev/hda1
    label=dos
```

LiLo has some shortages which is why grub and grub2 have been developed. But beside these Boot Loaders there are some other Boot Loaders which are not leaders but have been developed for specific purposes. As not all system has ext file system, we might need to load linux from inside of other files systems or medias:

| Boot Loader | Supported File System\(s\) | Usually Used Media |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| syslinux | FAT32 but support ext2, ext3, ext4 | USB |
| extlinux | FAT32 , ext3, ext4 | usually used on Hard Disk |
| isolinux | create .iso files | CD/DVD |

Creating a bootable media can become pretty strait forward, which is why  there are many many tools which help us to do that. like unetbootin, Rufus, Yumi,  ... .

### syslinux

```
root@server1:~# mkfs.vfat -F 32 -n KING8GIG /dev/sdb1
mkfs.fat 3.0.28 (2015-05-16)
root@server1:~# syslinux -maf /dev/sdb1
root@server1:~# mkdir /media/myflash
root@server1:~# mount /dev/sdb1 /media/myflash/
root@server1:~# mkdir /media/myflash/syslinux
root@server1:~# cp /usr/lib/syslinux/modules/bios/{vesamenu.c32,reboot.c32,poweroff.c32} /media/myflash/syslinux/
root@server1:~# mkdir /media/myflash/iso
```

```
root@server1:~# mkdir /media/myflash/iso/ubuntu_1404
root@server1:~# cp -r /media/payam/Ubuntu\ 14.04.3\ LTS\ amd64/* /media/myflash/iso/ubuntu_1404/
```
