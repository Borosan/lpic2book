#### Linux Boot Loaders[^1]

The grandfather of all linux boot loaders is LiLo \(Linux boot Loader\). LiLo has its configuration file in /etc/lilo.conf which was compiled to binary and reside on first sectors of hard disk. But all those good days of simplicity have been passed.  

```
#sample lilo.conf of system configured to boot 2 operating system.
boot=/dev/hda
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
prompt
timeout=50
message=/boot/message
lba32
default=linux

image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.0-0.43.6
	label=linux
	initrd=/boot/initrd-2.4.0-0.43.6.img
	read-only
	root=/dev/hda5

other=/dev/hda1
	label=dos
```

LiLo has some shortages which is way grub and grub2 has developed. But beside these Boot Loaders there are some other Boot Loaders which are not leaders but have been developed for specific purposes. As not all system has ext file system, we might need to load linux from inside of other files systems or partitions: 

| Boor Loader |  Supported File System\(s\) | Used Media |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| syslinux | ms-dos \(FAT32\) |  USB |
| ext linux | FAT32 , ext3, ext4 | usually used on Hard Disk |
| iso linux | create .iso files |  CD/DVD |
