### **204.2 Adjusting Storage Device Access**

**Weight:** 2

**Description:** Candidates should be able to configure kernel options to support various drives. This objective includes software tools to view & modify hard disk settings including iSCSI devices.

**Key Knowledge Areas:**

* Tools and utilities to configure DMA for IDE devices including ATAPI and SATA
* Tools and utilities to configure Solid State Drives including AHCI and NVMe
* Tools and utilities to manipulate or analyse system resources \(e.g. interrupts\)
* Awareness of sdparm command and its uses
* Tools and utilities for iSCSI
* Awareness of SAN, including relevant protocols \(AoE, FCoE\)

**Terms and Utilities:**

* hdparm, sdparm
* nvme
* tune2fs
* fstrim
* sysctl
* /dev/hd\*, /dev/sd\*, /dev/nvme\*
* iscsiadm, scsi\_id, iscsid and iscsid.conf
* WWID, WWN, LUN numbers

In this course many standards and storage concepts are discussed. Before begging lets classified some topics and then we realize where each tools for.

| Storage Types | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| HDD | Hard Disk Drive, traditional mechanical hard disks stores data on magnetic platter. |
| SSD | Solid state drives \(SSDs\) are storage devices that contain non-volatile flash memory. they are superior to mechanical hard disk drives in terms of performance, power use, and availability. |
| NVMe | non-volatile memory expres \(NVMe\) devices are flash memory chips connected to a system via the PCI-E bus. |

and from another aspect :

| Storage Connectivity Protocols | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| IDE/ATA | Popular Interface, used to connect hard disks and optical drives. speed: 133 MB/s |
| Serial ATA | Serial Version of IDE/ATA typically used for internal connectivity.speed up to 16 Gb/s |
| SCSI | Popular standard for compute-to-storage connectivity.speed up to 640 MB/s |
| SAS | Serial attached SCSI, is a point-to-point serial protocol that provides alternative to SCSI.speed up to 12 Gb/s |
| FC | Fibre Channel a widely-used-protocol for high-spedd communication to the storage device. Latest version speed up to 32 Gb/s |
| IP | IP is a network protocol that has been traditionally used for compute-to-compute traffic.ISCSI and FCIP protocols are common examples of using IP for compute-to-storage communications. |

Now lets get familiar with some linux tools for specific Hard Drives:

### hdparm

hdparm is a command line program to set and view ATA hard disk drive hardware parameters. First \(in 2005\) hdparm utility  developed by Mrk Lord to test Linux drivers for IDE hard drives. Since then, the program has developed into a valuable tool for diagnosis and tuning of hard drives  It can set parameters such as drive caches, sleep mode, power management and DMA settings.As hdparm interacts directly with hardware it can cause data lost and other file system damages.

hdparm has to be run with root privileges, otherwise it will either not be found or the requested actions will not be executed properly.

```

lets check how fast is my ssd drive with -t switch:

```
root@server1:~# hdparm -t /dev/sda

/dev/sda:
 Timing buffered disk reads: 1528 MB in  3.00 seconds = 509.06 MB/sec
```

Wow 509.06 MB/ sec.Not bad :\). Some other amazing parameters and features that can be manipulated with hdparm:

| hdparam command switch | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| hdparm -B 125 /dev/sda | Set the Advanced Power Management, valus &lt;1-255&gt;. While 1-127 permit spin-down, 128-254 no not allow spin-down and 255 disable feature completly |
| hdparm -S 240 /dev/sda | Set standby time.specifies how long to wait in idle \(with no disk activity\) before turning off the motor to save power. 0 can disbale feature,the values from 1 to 240 specify multiples of 5 seconds and values from 241 to 251 specify multiples of 30 minutes. |
| hdparm -d 1 /dev/sda | set DMA \(Direct Memory Access\)on   or off,values 0 or 1 |

and many many other options.

### sdparm

scsi version of hdparm. sdparm manupulate scsi specific attributes of hard drive.

### NVMEe

Linux has NVMe driver which is natively included in the kernel since version 3.3. NVMe devices should show up under /dev/nvme\*

### tune2fs

tune2fs command is used by the system administrator to change/modify tunable parameters on ext2, ext3 and ext4 type filesystems. Incomparison to hdparm it manipulates disk drive from File System layer.

```
root@server1:~# tune2fs 
tune2fs 1.42.13 (17-May-2015)
Usage: tune2fs [-c max_mounts_count] [-e errors_behavior] [-g group]
    [-i interval[d|m|w]] [-j] [-J journal_options] [-l]
    [-m reserved_blocks_percent] [-o [^]mount_options[,...]] [-p mmp_update_interval]
    [-r reserved_blocks_count] [-u user] [-C mount_count] [-L volume_label]
    [-M last_mounted_dir] [-O [^]feature[,...]]
    [-Q quota_options]
    [-E extended-option[,...]] [-T last_check_time] [-U UUID]
    [ -I new_inode_size ] device
```

We have already seen tune2fs -l /dev/sda command and we have used -i and -c flags to change fsck check interval. Lets do something more interesting. By default every File System in Linux has some space reserved for root, so no regular user can fill file system up to 100%. As a standard, each File System reserve 5% of total space.Lets change it:

```
root@server1:~# tune2fs -l /dev/sda8 | grep -i reserved 
Reserved block count:     610355
Reserved GDT blocks:      1021
Reserved blocks uid:      0 (user root)
Reserved blocks gid:      0 (group root)

root@server1:~# tune2fs -m 6 /dev/sda8
tune2fs 1.42.13 (17-May-2015)
Setting reserved blocks percentage to 6% (732426 blocks)

root@server1:~# tune2fs -l /dev/sda8 | grep -i reserved 
Reserved block count:     732426
Reserved GDT blocks:      1021
Reserved blocks uid:      0 (user root)
Reserved blocks gid:      0 (group root)
```

When we have very huge partition, ext file system sparse lots of super blocks bakcups in different places of hard disk which consume noticeable space, we can Limit the number of backup superblocks to save space on large filesystems using `tune2fs -s 0 /dev/sda10`  command.

note that after any manipulation fsck should be run in order to changes take effect.

### sysctl

We have previously seen sysctl as a tool to view and change kernel parameters at the run time. sysctl deals with /proc directory .

```
root@blackbird:~# sysctl 

Usage:
 sysctl [options] [variable[=value] ...]

Options:
  -a, --all            display all variables
  -A                   alias of -a
  -X                   alias of -a
      --deprecated     include deprecated parameters to listing
  -b, --binary         print value without new line
  -e, --ignore         ignore unknown variables errors
  -N, --names          print variable names without values
  -n, --values         print only values of a variables
  -p, --load[=<file>]  read values from file
  -f                   alias of -p
      --system         read values from all system directories
  -r, --pattern <expression>
                       select setting that match expression
  -q, --quiet          do not echo variable set
  -w, --write          enable writing a value to variable
  -o                   does nothing
  -x                   does nothing
  -d                   alias of -h

 -h, --help     display this help and exit
 -V, --version  output version information and exit

For more details see sysctl(8).
```

We  used sysctl -a to list all parameters ,and as an example we know   sysctl  -w net.ipv4.ipforward=1 is the same as echo "1" &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip\_forward. Then for marking changes persistent we learned that sysctl has a configuration file which is /etc/sysctl.conf[^1] and kernel parameters are defined there.

### What is LUN?

a logical unit number, or LUN, is a number used to identify a logical unit, which is a device addressed by the SCSI protocol or Storage Area Network protocols which encapsulate SCSI, such as Fibre Channel or iSCSI.

### iscsi "EYE-skuzzy"

Befor talking about iscsi, lets talk about scsi to understand it better, Whats scsi? SCSI "skuzzy"  \( Small Computer System Interface\), is a set of American National Standards Institute \(ANSI\) standard electronic interfaces that allow personal computers \(PCs\) to communicate with peripheral hardware such as disk drives, tape drives, CD-ROM drives, printers and scanners faster and more flexibly than previous parallel data transfer interfaces . But what if we could do it remotely?

iSCSI \(Internet Small Computer System Interface\), works on top of the  TCP \(Transport Control Protocol\) and allows the SCSI command to be sent end-to-end over LANs and  WANs or the Internet.

How dose it work? iSCSI works by transporting block-level data between an iSCSI initiator on a computer\(as client\) and an iSCSI target on a storage device\(as server\). The iSCSI protocol encapsulates SCSI commands and assembles the data in packets for the TCP/IP layer. Packets are sent over the network using a point-to-point connection. When packets arrived, the iSCSI protocol disassembles the packets, take out  SCSI commands so the operating system  will see the storage as a local SCSI device that can be formatted as usual.

![](/assets/iscsi.jpg)

#### iqn,EUI

Each iscsi target or iscsi initirator is called iscsi node.All iSCSI nodes are identified by an iSCSI name. An iSCSI name is not IP address or DNS name of that host. Names enable iSCSI storage resources to be managed regardless of  other kind of addresses, Also it is  used in authentication of targets to initiators and initiators to targets.

iSCSI addresses can be one of two types:

1. iSCSI Qualified Name \(iQN\) 
2. IEEE Naming convention \(EUI\)

iQN format ‐ iqn.yyyy‐mm.com.xyz.aabbccddeeffgghh :

* iqn ‐ Naming convention identifier
* yyyy‐nn ‐ Point in time when the .com domain was registered
* com.xyz ‐ Domain of the node backwards
* aabbccddeeffgghh ‐ Device identifier \(can be a WWN[^2], the system name, or any other vendorimplemented
   standard\)

EUI format ‐ eui.64‐bit WWN:

* eui ‐ Naming prefix
* 64‐bit WWN ‐ FC WWN of the host

Okey enough introduction lets start.To keep it simple we use CentOS 7 server \(target\) with additional 10 gig Disk Drive and then get Our Ubuntu client \(initiator\) connected to it. First We need to add EPEL repository:

```
###Server Side , CentOS with 10 gig Disk, iscsitarget
[root@server1 ~]# yum install epel-release
```

and now lets install iscsi target:

```
[root@server1 ~]# yum search scsi target

Do not forget to `sysemctl enable tgt.service` to keep iscsi target service Active even after reboot. Before testing we have to make tcp port 3260 open, CentOS 7 use firewalld on top of iptables so we use firewall-cmd to manipulate ip table:

```
[root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --add-port=3260/tcp --zone=public --permanent
success
[root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --reload
success
 [root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all

okey its time to configure our client as iscsi initiator , we use ubuntu 16 here:

```
###Client side, ubuntu 16.04, initiator
root@server2:~# apt install open-iscsi
```

lets configure iscsi initiator  `vi /etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf`  :

```
#
# Open-iSCSI default configuration.
# Could be located at /etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf or ~/.iscsid.conf
#
# Note: To set any of these values for a specific node/session run
# the iscsiadm --mode node --op command for the value. See the README
# and man page for iscsiadm for details on the --op command.
#

######################

# ********
# Timeouts
# ********
#
# See the iSCSI REAME's Advanced Configuration section for tips
# on setting timeouts when using multipath or doing root over iSCSI.
#
# To specify the length of time to wait for session re-establishment
# before failing SCSI commands back to the application when running
# the Linux SCSI Layer error handler, edit the line.
# The value is in seconds and the default is 120 seconds.
# Special values:
# - If the value is 0, IO will be failed immediately.
# - If the value is less than 0, IO will remain queued until the session
# is logged back in, or until the user runs the logout command.

# Time interval to wait for on connection before sending a ping.
node.conn[0].timeo.noop_out_interval = 5

# To specify the time to wait for a Nop-out response before failing
# the connection, edit this line. Failing the connection will
# cause IO to be failed back to the SCSI layer. If using dm-multipath
# this will cause the IO to be failed to the multipath layer.
node.conn[0].timeo.noop_out_timeout = 5

# To specify the time to wait for abort response before

# The value is in seconds and the default is 15 seconds.
node.session.err_timeo.abort_timeout = 15

# To specify the time to wait for a logical unit response

#******
# Retry
#******

# To specify the number of times iscsid should retry a login
# if the login attempt fails due to the node.conn[0].timeo.login_timeout
# expiring modify the following line. Note that if the login fails
# quickly (before node.conn[0].timeo.login_timeout fires) because the network
# layer or the target returns an error, iscsid may retry the login more than
# node.session.initial_login_retry_max times.
#
# This retry count along with node.conn[0].timeo.login_timeout
# determines the maximum amount of time iscsid will try to
# establish the initial login. node.session.initial_login_retry_max is
# multiplied by the node.conn[0].timeo.login_timeout to determine the
# maximum amount.
#
# The default node.session.initial_login_retry_max is 8 and
# node.conn[0].timeo.login_timeout is 15 so we have:
#
# node.conn[0].timeo.login_timeout * node.session.initial_login_retry_max =
#                                120 seconds
#
# Valid values are any integer value. This only
# affects the initial login. Setting it to a high value can slow
# down the iscsi service startup. Setting it to a low value can
# cause a session to not get logged into, if there are distuptions
# during startup or if the network is not ready at that time.
node.session.initial_login_retry_max = 8

################################
# session and device queue depth

#
# Setting the thread's priority to a lower value can lead to higher throughput
# and lower latencies. The lowest value is -20. Setting the priority to
# a higher value, can lead to reduced IO performance, but if you are seeing
# the iscsi or scsi threads dominate the use of the CPU then you may want
# to set this value higher.
#
# Note: For cxgb3i you must set all sessions to the same value, or the
# behavior is not defined.

### Copy and uncoment and modify:


node.session.auth.username = myuser 
node.session.auth.password = mypassword
```

and lets start the service:

```
root@server2:~# systemctl start iscsid.service
```

and check with iscsiadm tool:

```
root@server2:~# iscsiadm --mode discovery -t sendtargets --portal 192.168.10.134
192.168.10.134:3260,1 192.168.10.134:target00
```

see current hard disk of our client and lets add new hard disk using iscsiadm:

```
root@server2:~# ls /dev/sd*
/dev/sda  /dev/sda1  /dev/sda2  /dev/sda5

root@server2:~# iscsiadm --mode node --targetname 192.168.10.134:target00 --portal 192.168.10.134 --login
Logging in to [iface: default, target: 192.168.10.134:target00, portal: 192.168.10.134,3260] (multiple)
Login to [iface: default, target: 192.168.10.134:target00, portal: 192.168.10.134,3260] successful.

root@server2:~# ls /dev/sd*
/dev/sda  /dev/sda1  /dev/sda2  /dev/sda5    /dev/sdb
```

okey /dev/sdb is added, if you have noticed. to confirm:

```
root@server2:~# iscsiadm -m session -o show
tcp: [1] 192.168.10.134:3260,1 192.168.10.134:target00 (non-flash)
root@server2:~# cat /proc/partitions 
major minor  #blocks  name
   8        0   52428800 sda
   8        1   51380224 sda1
   8        2          1 sda2
   8        5    1045504 sda5
  11        0    1048575 sr0
   8       32   10485760 sdb
```

and if we reboot the system BoOoMM! every thing is gone! to make it persistent  change `node.startup = manual`  
 to  automatic inside /etc/iscsi/iscsi.conf file. and copy iscsiadm script to /etc/rc.local and enable it if required:

```
root@server2:~# echo "iscsiadm --mode node --targetname 192.168.10.134:target00 --portal 192.168.10.134 --login" >> /etc/rc.local
root@server2:~# systemctl enable rc-local.service 
root@server2:~# chmod 750 /etc/rc.local
```

and we are done. Now we can format mount the partition or we can add it to fstab using `_netdev` option.
