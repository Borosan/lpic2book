### **204.2 Adjusting Storage Device Access**

**Weight:** 2

**Description:** Candidates should be able to configure kernel options to support various drives. This objective includes software tools to view & modify hard disk settings including iSCSI devices.

**Key Knowledge Areas:**

* Tools and utilities to configure DMA for IDE devices including ATAPI and SATA
* Tools and utilities to configure Solid State Drives including AHCI and NVMe
* Tools and utilities to manipulate or analyse system resources \(e.g. interrupts\)
* Awareness of sdparm command and its uses
* Tools and utilities for iSCSI
* Awareness of SAN, including relevant protocols \(AoE, FCoE\)

**Terms and Utilities:**

* hdparm, sdparm
* nvme
* tune2fs
* fstrim
* sysctl
* /dev/hd\*, /dev/sd\*, /dev/nvme\*
* iscsiadm, scsi\_id, iscsid and iscsid.conf
* WWID, WWN, LUN numbers

### hdparm

hdparm is a command line program to set and view ATA hard disk drive hardware parameters. First \(in 2005\) hdparm utility  developed by Mrk Lord to test Linux drivers for IDE hard drives. Since then, the program has developed into a valuable tool for diagnosis and tuning of hard drives  It can set parameters such as drive caches, sleep mode, power management and DMA settings.As hdparm interacts directly with hardware it can cause data lost and other file system damages.

hdparm has to be run with root privileges, otherwise it will either not be found or the requested actions will not be executed properly.

```

```

### sdparm

scsi version of hdparm. sdparm manupulate scsi specific attributes of hard drive.

### tune2fs

to do things on file system, one more  abstraction level

### sysctl

change those settings in proc
