# **Topic 201: Linux Kernel**

### **201.1 Kernel Components**

**Weight:** 2

**Description:** Candidates should be able to utilize kernel components that are necessary to specific hardware, hardware drivers, system resources and requirements. This objective includes implementing different types of kernel images, identifying stable and development kernels and patches, as well as using kernel modules.

**Key Knowledge Areas:**

* Kernel 2.6.x, 3.x and 4.x documentation

**Terms and Utilities:**

* /usr/src/linux/
* /usr/src/linux/Documentation/
* zImage
* bzImage
* xz compression

#### Kernel Version Numbering

Linux Kernel as heart of Linux Operating System was numbered from its beginning. The rule rule of version numbering was like this:

| 2 | 5 | 75 | 3 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Version Number | Major Revision | Minor Revision | Correction/Patch |

where the "odd" or "even" revision number had different concepts.  "odd" numbers was used for "development versions" and this showed they where some how unstable and weren't suitable for production environment. On the other hand "even" reversion number showed "stable" version and so it gave hope for Reliability. But this story is for past. When Kernel 2.6 arrived they decided  to release just "stable" kernels and so they stick to version 2.6.X. So all versions after 2.6 , weather they have "odd" or "even" numbers, they are all "stable. Kernel 2.6.X was alive till version number  2.6.39.4 , that is a long number huh ? Finally Linus Trovalds accepted to using  version 3 and so on . and changed the rule:

| 3 | 0 | X |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Version Number | Major Reversion | Minor Reversion |

and we don't need to be worried about correction/patch number. 3.19 is last version and version 4 is active now. Lets Check :

```
root@server1:~# uname -a
Linux server1 4.10.0-40-generic #44~16.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Thu Nov 9 15:37:44 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
root@server1:~# uname -r
4.10.0-40-generic
root@server1:~# 
```

as you can see we are on version "4", Major release "10" and ubuntu specified patch "0-40-generic"

To learn How Linux Kernels and its components are placed in different places of linux tree, think of octopus. This way you will have enough insight to work with kernel, upgrade it and troubleshoot linux system. lets take a look at these places:

#### initrd

initrd \(initial ramdisk\) is a scheme for loading a temporary root file system into memory, which may be used as part of the Linux startup process. initrd and initramfs refer to two different methods of achieving this. Both are commonly used to make preparations before the real root file system can be mounted.[^1]
