### **204.3 Logical Volume Manager**

**Weight:** 3

**Description: **Candidates should be able to create and remove logical volumes, volume groups, and physical volumes. This objective includes snapshots and resizing logical volumes.

**Key Knowledge Areas:**

* Tools in the LVM suite
* Resizing, renaming, creating, and removing logical volumes, volume groups, and physical volumes
* Creating and maintaining snapshots
* Activating volume groups

**Terms and Utilities:**

* /sbin/pv\*
* /sbin/lv\*
* /sbin/vg\*
* mount
* /dev/mapper/
* lvm.conf

### LVM

 In traditional storage management, Operating system searchs for Disk Drives like /dev/sda, /dev/sdb and then looks for what partitions are available on the disks like /dev/sda1, /dev/sdb1 .Partitions are limited to the disks and they are not so flexible. Logical Volume Manager \(LVM\) bring us flexibility by creatingan abstraction layer between Operating System and Disk Devices.

LVM functions by layering abstractions on top of physical storage devices, The basic layers that LVM use are:

* physical volumes\(pv\):A physical volume is typically a hard disk, though it may well just be a device that 'looks' like a hard disk \(ex:software raid device\) 
* volume groups\(vg\): The Volume Group is the highest level abstraction used within the LVM. It gathers together a collection of Physical Volumes and Logical Volumes into one administrative unit
* logical volumes\(lv\):The equivalent of a disk partition in a non-LVM system. logical volume takes  disk space from disk space which is available on volume groups. On top of logical volumes we create File  Systems\( xfs, ext4, ...\)

Redhat base Systems setup lvm during installation, so here we use ubuntu to create lvm :







While using RAID can give us performance and reliability, LVM cause flexibility.
