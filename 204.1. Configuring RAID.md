### **204.1 Configuring RAID**

**Weight:** 3

**Description:** Candidates should be able to configure and implement software RAID. This objective includes using and configuring RAID 0, 1 and 5.

**Key Knowledge Areas:**

* Software raid configuration files and utilities

**Terms and Utilities:**

* mdadm.conf
* mdadm
* /proc/mdstat
* partition type 0xFD

#### What is RAID?

RAID \(redundant array of independent disks; originally redundant array of inexpensive disks\) is a way of storing the same data in different places on multiple hard disks to protect data in the case of a drive failure. However, not all RAID levels provide redundancy.

#### How RAID Works?

RAID works by placing data on multiple disks and allowing input/output \(I/O\) operations to overlap in a balanced way, improving performance. Because the use of multiple disks increases the mean time between failures \(MTBF\), storing data redundantly also increases fault tolerance.

RAID arrays appear to the operating system \(OS\) as a single logical hard disk. RAID employs the techniques of disk mirroring or disk striping.

* Mirroring copies identical data onto more than one drive.

* Striping partitions each drive's storage space into units ranging from a sector \(512 bytes\) up to several megabytes\(designed based on needs of a system\). The stripes of all the disks are interleaved and addressed in order.

Parity is a concept, which is also streamlined into RAID technology as another way of storage method. It involves saving of information across the disk arrays, so that, the same information can be used to recreate or reconstruct the affected data, which is otherwise filled with errors or data loss, when disk drive fails.

Disk mirroring and disk striping can be combined on a RAID array.

#### RAID Controller

A RAID controller can be used as a level of abstraction between the OS and the physical disks, presenting groups of disks as logical units. Using a RAID controller can improve performance and help protect data in case of a crash.

A RAID controller can be used in both hardware- and software-based RAID arrays.

* In a hardware-based RAID product, a physical controller manages the array. When in the form of a Peripheral Component Interconnect or PCI Express card, the controller can be designed to support drive formats such as SATA and SCSI. A physical RAID controller can also be part of the motherboard.
* With software-based RAID, the controller uses the resources of the hardware system. While it performs the same functions as a hardware-based RAID controller, software-based RAID controllers may not enable as much of a performance boost.

#### RAID Levels

Data is distributed across the drives in one of several ways, referred to as RAID levels, depending on the required level of redundancy and performance. The different  data distribution layouts, are named by the word "RAID" followed by a number, for example RAID 0 or RAID 1. Each  RAID level, provides a different balance among reliability, availability, performance, and capacity.

* When RAID was introduced first in 1988 six different RAID Levels were introduced, known as "standrad RAID levels".

* As time passes "Nested RAID Levels" are created based on a combination of "Standard RAID Levels"

* and then there are some " Nonstandard RAID levels". Like RAID7 .

### RAID levels comparison chart:

|  | RAID0 | RAID1 | RAID5 | RAID6 | RAID10 | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Min \# of Disks | 2 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 4 |  |
| Fault Tolerance | None | 1 disk | 1 disk | 2 disks | Up to one disk failure in each sub-array |  |
| Disk Space Over-Head | None | 50% | 1 disk | 2 disks | 50% |  |
| Read Speed | fast | fast | slow | slow | fast |  |
| Write Speed | fast | fair | slow | slow | fair |  |
| Cost | cheap | high\(disks\) | high | very high | high\(disks\) |  |
