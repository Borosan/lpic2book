# **Topic 202: System Startup**

### **202.1 Customizing SysV-init system startup**

**Weight: **3

**Description:** Candidates should be able to query and modify the behaviour of system services at various targets / run levels. A thorough understanding of the systemd, SysV Init and the Linux boot process is required. This objective includes interacting with systemd targets and SysV init run levels.

**Key Knowledge Areas:**

* Systemd
* SysV init
* Linux Standard Base Specification \(LSB\)

**Terms and Utilities:**

* /usr/lib/systemd/
* /etc/systemd/
* /run/systemd/
* systemctl
* systemd-delta
* /etc/inittab
* /etc/init.d/
* /etc/rc.d/
* chkconfig
* update-rc.d
* init and telinit

#### Over View

During the previous lessons we talked about initrd/initramfs. When the kernel completly loaded it searchs for init process to start it. init process can be init, upstart or systemd. Traditionally System v init is used to start other services but it has some short comings. So other solutions invented like upstart and systemd.

/sbin/init can be linked to upstart or systemd. to check which system you are running, check each directory existence:

| Directpry | Description \[if exist\] |
| :--- | :--- |
| /etc/init.d | Shows you have SysV in your linux box |
| /usr/share/upstart | You are on a Upstart Based system |
| /usr/lib/systemd | You are using Systemd-Based system |

also try stat /proc/1/exe

#### Sys v

System "5" or Sys "v" is an ancient method of handling system services  from unix world.
