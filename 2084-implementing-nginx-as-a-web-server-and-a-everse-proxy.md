### Whats is nginx ?![](.gitbook/assets/nginx-logo.png)

&#x20;**NGINX** (short for**Engine X**) is a free, open-source and powerful HTTP web server and reverse proxy with an event-driven (asynchronous) architecture. It is written using **C** programming language and runs on Unix-like operating systems as well as Windows OS.

It also works as a reverse proxy, standard mail and TCP/UDP proxy server, and can additionally be configured as a load balancer. It is powering many sites on the web. well known for its high-performance, stability and feature-rich set.

#### history

In 2002, Igor Sysoev start work on Nginx as a solution provider to the C10K problem, which was a extreme challenge for web servers to start handling ten thousand synchronized connections as a necessity for the modern network. The first public release of Nginx was made in 2004, meeting this goal by relying on an asynchronous, events-driven architecture.

#### nginx vs apache

Apache and Nginx both are the most common open source web servers. Together, both web servers are responsible for serving over 50% of traffic on the internet. Both solutions are capable of handling different workloads and working with other software to provide a full web stack.

While Apache and Nginx split many qualities, they should not be consideration of as completely interchangeable. Each has been developed in its own way and it is important to understand the situations where we may need to re-evaluate ourweb server of choices. This table will show how each web server stacks up in various areas:

| Criterian     | Apache                                                                | Nginx                                                                                        |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Static speed  | Second to nginx                                                       | 2.5x faster than apache                                                                      |
| Dynamic speed | Both same in this area                                                | Both same in this area                                                                       |
| OS support    | Unix, Windows, Mac OSX                                                | works great with Unix-like OS. Not so with windows.                                          |
| Security      | Both have excellent security track record                             | Both have excellent security track record                                                    |

| Cost          | Open source hence free to download and support                        | Open source license available along with paid liencese for advanced features like NGINX plus |

Comparing and getting deeper to nginx features is beyond the scope of this lesson but it is recommanded to invest some time on it.

In this course we will stablish a basic web server using nginx and then implement a revere proxy using that.

### Basic Web server

Lets start by installing Nginx web server from Ubuntu official repositories:

```
root@server1:~# apt install nginx
```

```
root@server1:~# systemctl status nginx.service

```

### /etc/nginx/

All NGINX configuration files are located in the /etc/nginx/ directory.

```
root@server1:~# cd /etc/nginx/

```

The primary configuration file is /etc/nginx/nginx.conf:

```
root@server1:/etc/nginx# cat nginx.conf

In CentOS the configuration file would be like this:

```
[root@centos7-1 nginx]# cat nginx.conf

}
```

Configuration options in NGINX are called directives. Directives are organized into groups known as blocks (or contexts,They are synonymous)

Lines preceded by a # character are comments and not interpreted by NGINX. Lines containing directives must end with a ; or NGINX will fail to load the configuration and report an error.

The file starts with 5 irectives:`user`,`worker_processes`,`error_log`, and`pid`. These are outside any specific block or context, so they’re said to exist in the`main`context. See [the NGINX docs](https://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx\_core\_module.html) for explanations of these directives and others available in the `main`context.

The`events`and`http`blocks are areas for additional directives, and they also exist in the`main`context.

* **The http Block :**The http block contains directives for handling web traffic. These directives are often referred to as universal because they are passed on to to all website configurations NGINX serves.See [the NGINX docs](https://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx\_core\_module.html) for a list of available directives for the http block.
* **Server Blocks :** The`http`block above contains an`include`directive which tells NGINX where website Configuration files are located.

If we installed from the official NGINX repository, or RedHat, this line will say`include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;`as it does in the`http`block above. Each website we host with NGINX should have its own configuration file in`etc/nginx/conf.d/`, with the name formatted as`example.com.conf`. Sites which are disabled (not being served by NGINX) should be named `xample.com.conf.disabled`.

If we installed NGINX from the Debian or Ubuntu repositories, this line will say`include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;`. The`../sites-enabled/`folder contains symlinks to the site configuration files stored in`/etc/nginx/sites-available/`. Sites in`sites-available`can be disabled by removing the symlink to`sites-enabled`.

#
#    root /var/www/example.com;
#    index index.html;
#
#    location / {
#        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
#    }
#}
```

Regardless of the installation source, server configuration files will contain as`server`block (or blocks) for a website.

* **Listening ports :** The `listen`directive tells NGINX the hostname/IP and the TCP port where it should listen for HTTP connections. The argument `default_server` means this virtual host will answer requests on port 80 that don’t specifically match another virtual host’s listen statement. The second statement listens over IPv6 and behaves similarly.
* **Name-based virtual Hosting :** The `server_name` directive allows multiple domains to be served from a single IP address. The server decides which domain to serve based on the request header it receives.

```
     #examples: 
              #process requests for two addresses:
              serve_name       example.com www.example.com;
              # using wildcrads
              server_name       *.example.com;
              server_name       .example.com;
              #Process requests for all domain names beginning with example.
              server_name       example.*;
```

NGINX allows us to specify server names that are not valid domain names. NGINX uses the name from the HTTP header to answer requests, regardless of whether the domain name is valid or not.

Using non-domain hostnames is useful if our server is on a LAN, or if we already know all of the clients that will be making requests of the server.

* **Location Blocks :** The `location`setting lets we configure how NGINX will respond to requests for resources within the server. Just like the `server_name`directive tells NGINX how to process requests for the domain, `location`directives cover requests for specific files and folders, such as `http://example.com/blog/`.  `location`also supports regular expressions:

```
    ~* : matches to be case-insensitive
    ^~ :tells NGINX, if it matches a particular string, to stop searching for more specific matches and use the directives here instead. Other than that, these directives work like the literal string matches in the first group. Even if there’s a more specific match later, if a request matches one of these directives, the settings here will be used. See below for more information about the order and priority of location directive processing.
    =  : this forces an exact match with the path requested and then stops searching for more specific matches.
```

*   **Location Root and Index:** The`location`setting is another variable that has its own block of arguments.

    Once NGINX has determined which`location`directive best matches a given request, the response to this request is determined by the contents of the associated`location`directive block. Here’s an example:

```
location / {
    root html;
    index index.html index.htm;
}
```

In this example, the document root is located in the`html/`directory. Under the default installation prefix for NGINX, the full path to this location is`/etc/nginx/html/`.The`index`variable tells NGINX which file to serve if none is specified.

### /usr/share/ngnix/html

The default public web root in NGNIX is `/usr/share/ngnix/html` how ever, here in ubuntu16.04 the default web root is:

```
root@server1:/etc/nginx/sites-available# cat default | grep root
    root /var/www/html;
    # deny access to .htaccess files, if Apache's document root
#    root /var/www/example.com;
root@server1:/etc/nginx/sites-available# cd /var/www/html/
root@server1:/var/www/html# ls -l
total 4
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 612 Jun 30 03:17 index.nginx-debian.html
```

Lets create ourselves index.html :

```
root@server1:/var/www/html# mv index.nginx-debian.html index.nginx-debian.bak
root@server1:/var/www/html# vim index.html
root@server1:/var/www/html# cat index.html 
<h1> example site powered by NGINX ! </h1>
root@server1:/var/www/html# systemctl restart nginx.service
```

and lets chek the results:

```
root@server1:/var/www/html# telnet localhost 80
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET /index.html
<h1> example site powered by NGINX ! </h1>
Connection closed by foreign host.
```

## nginx command

nginx deamon has a handy command tool `nginx`which can help us save more time, see some of switches:

```
root@server1:~# nginx -?
nginx version: nginx/1.10.3 (Ubuntu)
Usage: nginx [-?hvVtTq] [-s signal] [-c filename] [-p prefix] [-g directives]

Options:
  -?,-h         : this help
  -v            : show version and exit
  -V            : show version and configure options then exit
  -t            : test configuration and exit
  -T            : test configuration, dump it and exit
  -q            : suppress non-error messages during configuration testing
  -s signal     : send signal to a master process: stop, quit, reopen, reload
                    stop — shut down quickly

## Reverse Proxy

ngnix can be configured to works as a Reversy Proxy. It seats some where between client and web server and can do caching, loadbalancing, acceleration, client Authentication, bandwidth management and etc.

The most significant beneit of using proxies in our networks is server abstaraction. Becuase the client sees the proxy and not the actual server itself. From other side, when the server respond to the client request,it responds to the proxy , which respond to the client. This way we have added an abstaraction layer between client and the server. Client just sees the proxy server and doesn't have any idea about server configuration and on the other hand server is protected from evil hackers.

Working as a ReverseProxy is what ngnix is famous for and configuring it is so simple.It is configured as like as a virtual host.So lets start, we use Ubuntu and use previous basic web server. we have setup to proxy example.com:

```
root@server1:~# vim /etc/hosts
root@server1:~# cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1    localhost
127.0.1.1    ubuntu
127.0.0.1    example.com
# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
root@server1:~# ping example.com 
PING example.com (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.017 ms
64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.098 ms
64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.076 ms
^C
--- example.com ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2034ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.017/0.063/0.098/0.035 ms
```

Now we want to proxy request for example.com to the google.com, for that we need some configurations.

```
root@server1:~# cd /etc/nginx/
root@server1:/etc/nginx# ls -l
total 56
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jul 12  2017 conf.d
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1077 Feb 11  2017 fastcgi.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1007 Feb 11  2017 fastcgi_params
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2837 Feb 11  2017 koi-utf
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2223 Feb 11  2017 koi-win
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 3957 Feb 11  2017 mime.types
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1462 Feb 11  2017 nginx.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  180 Feb 11  2017 proxy_params
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  636 Feb 11  2017 scgi_params
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jul  1 22:33 sites-available
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jun 30 03:17 sites-enabled
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jun 30 03:17 snippets
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  664 Feb 11  2017 uwsgi_params
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 3071 Feb 11  2017 win-utf
```

The simplest and minimal configuration which are requred for setting up a reverse proxy using nginx is inside `proxy_param` :

```
root@server1:/etc/nginx# cat proxy_params 
proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
```

We need weather copy these configuration inside our virtual host or as we do here, include it.

```
root@server1:/etc/nginx# cd sites-available/
root@server1:/etc/nginx/sites-available# ls -l
total 4
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2074 Feb 11  2017 default
root@server1:/etc/nginx/sites-available# vim example.com
root@server1:/etc/nginx/sites-available# cat example.com 
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location \ {
        proxy_pass http://lxer.com/;
        include /etc/nginx/proxy_params;
        }
    }
```

Now lets make it enable and restart the nginx service:

```
root@server1:/etc/nginx/sites-available# cd ../sites-enabled/
root@server1:/etc/nginx/sites-enabled# ln -s ../sites-available/example.com .
root@server1:/etc/nginx/sites-enabled# ls -l
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 34 Jun 30 03:17 default -> /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 30 Jul  1 22:48 example.com -> ../sites-available/example.com

root@server1:/etc/nginx/sites-enabled# systemctl restart nginx.service 
root@server1:/etc/nginx/sites-enabled# systemctl status nginx.service

```

Now it is time to check the results:

```
root@server1:/etc/nginx/sites-enabled# elinks http://example.com
```

and see what will happend.
