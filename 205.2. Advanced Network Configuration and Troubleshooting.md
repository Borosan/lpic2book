* [ ] ### **205.2 Advanced Network Configuration and Troubleshooting**

**Weight:** 4

**Description:** Candidates should be able to configure a network device to implement various network authentication schemes. This objective includes configuring a multi-homed network device and resolving communication problems.

**Key Knowledge Areas:**

* Utilities to manipulate routing tables
* Utilities to configure and manipulate ethernet network interfaces
* Utilities to analyze the status of the network devices
* Utilities to monitor and analyze the TCP/IP traffic

**Terms and Utilities:**

* ip
* ifconfig
* route
* arp
* ss
* netstat
* lsof
* ping, ping6
* nc
* tcpdump
* nmap

In this lesson we discuss about some other Network tools which help up in network trouble shooting.

#### What is socket?

In computer networking, and more definitely in software terms, a port is a logical entity which acts as a endpoint of communication to identify a given application or process on an Linux operating system. It is a 16-bit number \(0 to 65535\) which differentiates one application from another on end systems. Different categories of ports are:

* 0-1023 – the Well Known Ports, also referred to as System Ports.
* 1024-49151 – the Registered Ports, also known as User Ports.
* 49152-65535 – the Dynamic Ports, also referred to as the Private Ports.

The two most popular Internet transport protocols, Transmission Control Protocol \(TCP\) and the User Datagram Protocol \(UDP\) and other less known protocols use port numbers for communication sessions.

A combination of an IP address, port and protocol such as TCP/UDP is known as a socket, and every service must have a unique socket.

### netstat

netstat \(network statistics\)outputs network connections form local host perspective, routing, interface statistics, connections and multicast information. so its pretty handy.

netstat it self give us a log list of network information which might not be useful, so lets try some useful switches:

| useful netstat command switches | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| -s , --statistics | gives summary by protocol type and message type |
| -i , --interfaces | Display a table of all network interfaces |
| -r , --route | shows  routing table  information |
| -a , --all | Show both listening and non-listening sockets |
| -t , --tcp | Enabales listening of tcp ports |
| -u , --udp | Enables listening of udp ports |
| -l , --listening | Prints only listening  sockets |
| -p , --program | Shows PID and the name of associated program |
| -e , --extend | Shows additional information, use twice for more info |
| -n , --numeric | Shows numerical addresses |

netstat supports ipv6.

### ss

The ss command is capable of showing more information than the netstat and is faster. The netstat command reads various /proc files to gather information. However this approach falls weak when there are lots of connections to display. This makes it slower.

The ss command gets its information directly from kernel space. The options used with the ss commands are very similar to netstat making it an easy replacement.

If we use the ss command without any arguments or options, it will return a complete list of TCP sockets with established connections:

### lsof

To get a list of files which are opened by users and associated processes with them we use lsof \(LiSt Open Files\).

### nc

Netcat \(also known as ‘nc’ or ‘Swiss Army knife’\) is a networking utility used for reading or writing from TCP and UDP sockets using an easy interface. Netcat is used by Administrators, Developers and pen testers because of its features.

      .       .       
      \`-"'"-'/       
       } 6 6 {

     /           \_/  
    (     ____        
     \_.=|____E 

    root@server1:~# nc
    This is nc from the netcat-openbsd package. An alternative nc is available
    in the netcat-traditional package.
    usage: nc [-46bCDdhjklnrStUuvZz] [-I length] [-i interval] [-O length]
          [-P proxy_username] [-p source_port] [-q seconds] [-s source]
          [-T toskeyword] [-V rtable] [-w timeout] [-X proxy_protocol]
          [-x proxy_address[:port]] [destination] [port]

With netcat \(nc\) we can setup kind of client server connection over a specific port. For demo lets start chatting  between two  servers, server1 starts listening on port 12345:

```
root@server1:~# nc -l 12345
```

send text stream from server2 to server1:

```
root@server2:~$ su 
Password: 
root@server2:/home/payam# su -
root@server2:~# nc 192.168.10.152 80
Hello!
I'm here to send some messages over port 80
using netcat :)
```

and see the result on server1:

```
Hello!
I'm here to send some messages over port 80
using netcat :)
```

| netcat useful switches | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| -4 | Forces nc to use IP v4 only |
| -6 | Forces nc to use IP v6 only |
| -v | Give more verbose output |
| -n | Do not DNS Lookup for IP Addresses, Host Name or ports |
| -k | allow server to  continue listening  after client disconnect |
| -u | use udp |
| -w | setting up time out |

also we can use nc for prt scanning although netcat is not the best tool for the job:

```
root@server2:~# nc -v 192.168.10.152 -z 12340-12346
nc: connect to 192.168.10.152 port 12340 (tcp) failed: Connection refused
nc: connect to 192.168.10.152 port 12341 (tcp) failed: Connection refused
nc: connect to 192.168.10.152 port 12342 (tcp) failed: Connection refused
nc: connect to 192.168.10.152 port 12343 (tcp) failed: Connection refused
nc: connect to 192.168.10.152 port 12344 (tcp) failed: Connection refused
Connection to 192.168.10.152 12345 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
nc: connect to 192.168.10.152 port 12346 (tcp) failed: Connection refused
```

-z says that nc should just scan for listening daemons, without sending any data to them. can not be used with -l option.

### tcpdump

tcpdump is command-line packet sniffers and analyzer tool which is used to capture or filter TCP/IP packets which recieved or transfered over a network on a specific interface.

tcpdump also give us a option to save captured packets in a file in a pcap format. It is very useful for future analysis and also file can be viewed by tcpdump command or a open source GUI based tool like Wireshark.

```

### nmap

nmap \(Network Mapper\) is a security scanner.It is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network, whith the goal of building a "map" of the network. To accomplish it, Nmap sends specially designed packets to the target host\(s\) and then analyzes the responses. Nmap can adapt to network conditions including latency and congestion during a scan. The Nmap user community continues to develop and refine the tool.

![](/assets/sitelogo-transparent-googleplus.png)

Nmap was originally written for Linux, but it has been ported to major operating systems, such as Windows, Solaris, HP-UX, etc. There is even a free and open source GUI called Zenmap.

Although usually used for port scanning, Nmap offers many additional features:

* host discovery.
* operating system detection.
* service version detection.
* network information about targets, such as DNS names, device types, and MAC addresses.
* ability to scan for well-known vulnerabilities.

  nmap is not installed by default on most of linux distros and we need to install it:

```
root@server1:~# apt install  nmap
```

Before start scanning  please note that Port scanning without authorization is sometimes against the provider's acceptable use policy \(AUP\).

![](/assets/port-scanning.png)

Till the end of war Its better to test it on your own network and do not take the risk. nmap command with no option just prints its long list of switches and options. For our demonstartion we scan scanme.nmap.org :

```

Hmm. nmap has different techniques for scanning. But before explaining them we review some fundamentals.

#### TCP 3-Way Handshake Diagram

Below is a very simplified diagram of the TCP 3-way handshake process. Have a look at the diagram on the right as you examine the list of events on the left.

| Event | Diagram |
| :--- | :---: |
| ![](/assets/3way-handshake-events.jpg) | ![](/assets/3-way-handshake.gif) |

after this small review we can talk about nmap different methods of scanning[^2]:

* ##### TCP SYN Scan \(-sS\)

It is a basic scan, and it is also called half-open scanning because this technique allows Nmap to get information from the remote host without the complete TCP handshake process, Nmap sends SYN packets to the destination, but it does not create any sessions, As a result, the target computer can’t create any log of the interaction because no session was initiated, making this feature an advantage of the TCP SYN scan.`nmap -sT 192.168.10.151`

* ##### TCP connect\(\) scan \(-sT\)

This the default scanning technique used, if and only if the SYN scan is not an option, because the SYN scan requires root privilege. Unlike the TCP SYN scan, it completes the normal TCP three way handshake process and requires the system to call connect\(\), which is a part of the operating system. Keep in mind that this technique is only applicable to find out the TCP ports, not the UDP ports. `nmap -sT 192.168.10.151`

* **UDP Scan \(-sU\)**

As the name suggests, this technique is used to find an open UDP port of the target machine. It does not require any SYN packet to be sent because it is targeting the UDP ports. But we can make the scanning more effective by using -sS along with –sU. UDP scans send the UDP packets to the target machine, and waits for a response—if an error message arrives saying the ICMP is unreachable, then it means that the port is closed; but if it gets an appropriate response, then it means that the port is open.

`nmap -sU 192.168.10.151`

* **FIN Scan \(-sF\)**

Sometimes a normal TCP SYN scan is not the best solution because of the firewall. IDS and IPS scans might be deployed on the target machine, but a firewall will usually block the SYN packets. A FIN scan sends the packet only set with a FIN flag, so it is not required to complete the TCP handshaking.

The target computer is not able to create a log of this scan \(again, an advantage of FIN\). Just like a FIN scan, we can perform an xmas scan \(-sX\) and Null scan \(-sN\). The idea is same but there is a difference between each type of scan.

* **Ping Scan \(-sP\)**

Ping scanning is unlike the other scan techniques because it is only used to find out whether the host is alive or not, it is not used to discover open ports. Ping scans require root access s ICMP packets can be sent, but if the user does not have administrator privilege, then the ping scan uses connect\(\) call. `nmap -sP 192.168.10.151`

* **Version Detection \(-sV\)**

Version detection is the right technique that is used to find out what software version is running on the target computer and on the respective ports. It is unlike the other scanning techniques because it is not used to detect the open ports, but it requires the information from open ports to detect the software version. In the first step of this scan technique, version detection uses the TCP SYN scan to find out which ports are open.** **`nmap -sV 192.168.10.151`

* **Idle Scan \(-sI\)**

Idle scan is one of my favorite techniques, and it is an advance scan that provides complete anonymity while scanning. In idle scan, Nmap doesn’t send the packets from your real IP address—instead of generating the packets from the attacker machine, Nmap uses another host from the target network to send the packets. ex:** **`nmap -sI 192.168.1.6 192.168.1.1`

The idle scan technique \(as mentioned above\) is used to discover the open ports on 192.168.1.1 while it uses the zombie\_host \(192.168.1.6\) to communicate with the target host. So this is an ideal technique to scan a target computer anonymously.

There are many other scanning techniques are available like FTP bounce, fragmentation scan, ... but that is enough for LPIC exam.
