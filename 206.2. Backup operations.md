* /dev/st\* and /dev/nst\*
* mt
* rsync

### Why do we need to Backup?

We have already talk about RAID and LVM, although making RAID group or creating LVM, make sort of reliability and safetiness but they are not consider as backup solutions. We might lose data and experience failure because of different reasons:

* electricity goes off
* Hardware failure \(mobo, cpu, ram, hard disks, ...\)
* human kind miss configuration
* ...

To tell the truth the last reason is the most common and the most dangerous one. To avoid them we need to backup, we have to backup, we are forced to backup.

### What to backup?

Not all directories and file are required to be backed up especially when there backup space issues. In linux File System Hierarchy Standard \(FHS\) there are directories and files with different priority for backing up:

| Directory | Priority | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| /etc/ | high | system wide configuration files required for all programs |
| /home/ | high | Home directories for all users to store their personal files |
| /usr/local/ | high | contains users programs that you install from source |
| /var/lib/ | medium | contains lots of data, getting full backup leave us on the safe side. |
| /var/mail/ | medium | local emails |
| /var/www/ | medium | deafult web root |
| /var/spool/ | medium | printer queues but might used by some applications |
| /var/log/ | low | system log files |
| /opt/ | medium | Contains add-on applications from individual vendors |
| /usr/ | low | Contains binaries, libraries, documentation, and source-code for second level program |

### How to backup?

In any platform there are always some native tools and third party programs for backing up:

| Package | Licence | Language | Graphical user \(GUI\) interface | Command Line\(CMD\)interface |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ![](/assets/logo_amanda.png) | BSD | C , Perl | No \(except with Amanda Enterprise\) | Yes |
| ![](/assets/logo-backuppc.gif) | GPLv2.0 | Perl | Yes | Yes |
| ![](/assets/logo-bacula.png) | AGPLv3.0 | C , C++ | Yes | Yes |

All three Packages has Linux, windows, MacOS versions. Now lets spend time on some traditional native tools for backing up.

#### tape

Using tapes for backing up is some how out modded but tapes are still used because they are cheap and huge but they are very slow. If we have had  chance to administrate a system with tape device plugged, we would see these directories.

* /dev/st0
* /dev/nst0

The /dev/nst0 device is a non rewinding tape device, where as the /dev/st0 device is a rewinding tape device. The device you choose to use depends on your goal. Both devices are for the same piece of hardware but they behave differently. we can rewind  /dev/st0 by using   software but we can not use software for /dev/nst0 so we have to rewind it physically.

#### Understanding tape file marks and block size

Each tape device can store multiple tape backup files. Tape backup files are created using cpio, tar, dd, and so on. However, tape device can be opened, written data to, and closed by the various program. We can store several backups \(tapes\) on physical tape. Between each tape file is a “tape file mark”. This is used to indicate where one tape file ends and another begins on physical tape. You need to use mt command to positions the tape \(winds forward and rewinds and marks\)[^1].

#### mt command

mt command is used to control operations of the tape drive, such as finding status or seeking through files on a tape or writing tape control marks to the tape.

| some mt command examples | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| mt -f /dev/sto rewind | rewind tape drive |
|  |  |



#### How is data stored on a tape drive ?

All data is stored subsequently in sequential tape archive format using tar. The first tape archive will start on the physical beginning of the tape \(tar \#0\). The next will be tar \#1 and so on.
