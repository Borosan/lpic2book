### **200.1 Measure and Troubleshoot Resource Usage**

**Weight:** 6

**Description:** Candidates should be able to measure hardware resource and network bandwidth, identify and troubleshoot resource problems.

**Key Knowledge Areas:**

* Measure CPU usage
* Measure memory usage
* Measure disk I/O
* Measure network I/O
* Measure firewalling and routing throughput
* Map client bandwidth usage
* Match / correlate system symptoms with likely problems
* Estimate throughput and identify bottlenecks in a system including networking

**The following is a partial list of the used files, terms and utilities:**

* iostat
* netstat
* w
* top
* sar
* processes blocked on I/O
* blocks out
* vmstat
* pstree, ps
* Isof
* uptime
* swap
* blocks in



Computers hang, People Nags and Applications run with lags. Handling all of this problems is on administrators' shoulders. It doesn't matter if we are talking about a single computer or we are some where in the cloud. We need some tools to explore the behavior of a system in order to find a solution. Performance problems have two main roots, Sometimes lack of system resources such as CPU, Memory, HDD or even Network cause them, Sometimes we as humankind make mistakes. When there is a paradox between what we expect, what is in need and how we configure computers hang.
