### **200.1 Measure and Troubleshoot Resource Usage**

**Weight:** 6

**Description:** Candidates should be able to measure hardware resource and network bandwidth, identify and troubleshoot resource problems.

**Key Knowledge Areas:**

* Measure CPU usage
* Measure memory usage
* Measure disk I/O
* Measure network I/O
* Measure firewalling and routing throughput
* Map client bandwidth usage
* Match / correlate system symptoms with likely problems
* Estimate throughput and identify bottlenecks in a system including networking

**The following is a partial list of the used files, terms and utilities:**

* iostat
* netstat
* w
* top
* sar
* processes blocked on I/O
* blocks out
* vmstat
* pstree, ps
* Isof
* uptime
* swap
* blocks in

Computers hang, People Nags and Applications run with lags. Handling all of this problems is on administrators' shoulders. It doesn't matter if we are talking about a single computer or we are some where in the cloud. We need some tools to explore the behavior of a system in order to find a solution. Performance problems have two main roots, Sometimes lack of system resources such as CPU, Memory, HDD or even Network cause them, Sometimes we as humankind make mistakes. When there is a paradox between what we expect, what is in need and how we configure computers hang.

### Measure memory usage

RAM is like a gateway of a town, everything goes through RAM. If we have a process, it should be loaded in RAM first inorder to be served by CPU later. CPU feeds its Caches from RAM data. How about User activities? If user ask to read some data From HardDisk it is loaded in RAM and then user can work with that.

As it seeam RAM is pretty busy and always in need. Lets explorer whats going inside with some tools and commands.

```
root@server1:~# vmstat
procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ------cpu-----
 r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa st
 2  0  98012  79256  12136 319060    4   17   170    93   85  174  4  1 95  0  0
```

Linux uses Virtual Memory Technique to over come problems, the command vmstat show virtual memory status.
